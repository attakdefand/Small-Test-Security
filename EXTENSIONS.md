## ðŸ”§ Extensions Ready to Implement

These extensions are documented and planned but not yet implemented:

### Mobile API Testing
- Test API behavior with mobile user agents
- Validate bandwidth constraints
- Check battery optimization compatibility

### Mutation Testing
- Use tools like `cargo-mutants` to verify test effectiveness
- Measure test coverage quality

### Security Scanning
- Integrate with OWASP ZAP or similar tools
- Automated penetration testing

### Visualization Dashboards
- Create web dashboards for test results
- Trend analysis and historical reporting

### Distributed Testing
- Test API performance across different regions
- Validate global load balancing

## ðŸš€ Production Readiness Features

### Scalable Architecture
- Modular design allows selective testing
- Extensible without breaking existing functionality

### Industry Compliance
- Covers OWASP, GDPR, and security standards
- Implements recognized security testing patterns

### Performance Efficient
- Parallel test execution capabilities
- Configurable timeouts and retries

### Team Collaboration
- Clear reporting and documentation
- Standardized test structure

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated testing pipelines ready
- Configurable test execution strategies

## ðŸ“– How to Use Extended Features

### 1. Load Testing
```bash
# Install k6
# Run load tests
k6 run k6-tests/basic-load-test.js
```

### 2. GraphQL Testing
```bash
# Run with GraphQL endpoint available
cargo test graphql_query_test
```

### 3. WebSocket Testing
```bash
# Run with WebSocket endpoint available
cargo test websocket_connection_test
```

### 4. Run All Extended Tests
```bash
# Run all tests including ignored ones
cargo test -- --ignored
```
